# 3D Models Directory

## Required File: minifig.glb

Please place your LEGO minifigure GLB model file here as `minifig.glb`.

The app will automatically load this model and display it in the 3D scene.

### File Requirements:
- Format: GLB (Binary glTF)
- Name: `minifig.glb`
- Recommended size: < 10MB for optimal loading

### Finding GLB Models:
- Create your own using Blender and export as GLB
- Download from sites like Sketchfab, CGTrader, or TurboSquid
- Use online converters to convert OBJ/FBX to GLB

### Fallback:
If no GLB model is found, the app will use a basic geometric LEGO figure as a fallback.
